Profiling with the add of AI

Purpose:
1. Predictions by N(n=2) profiles advance. (HI% match).
2. Comparison (&constants) between output from test(=1) and T(n+) period of time. 
                          Differences & similarities between pseudorandom vs real subjects.
3. Determine the probability of next major choice in proximate time T(n->0) (see areas of interes).
4. Integrate known (theoretical) patterns.
5. Generate simulations until reveal of new patterns.
6. Link new data patterns with theoretic induction/deduction.
7. Decomposure of integral profiles into all series of accepted patterns.


Areas of interes - application:
1. Bio-psy correlations. Psycho-organic diseases.
2. Matrimonial & gender choices. Dating.
3. Professional path decission. Carrer.
